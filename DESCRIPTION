Description: RCTS has the functionality to cluster time series using the classical and robust interactive fixed effects framework. 
  The classical framework is based on Ando & Bai (2017) ("Clustering huge number of financial time series: A panel data approach with high-dimensional predictors and factor structures") and the robust approach on Boudt & Heyndels (2022) ("Robust interactive fixed effects").
  The method iteratively updates beta (the coefficients of the observable variables), group membership, and the latent factors (which can be common and group-specific) along
  with their loadings. The number of groups and factors can be estimated if they are unknown.
