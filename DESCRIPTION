Description: RCTS has the functionality to cluster time series using the classical and robust interactive fixed effects framework from Ando and Bai (Clustering huge number of financial time series: A panel data approach with high-dimensional predictors and factor structures (2017)) and Boudt and Heyndels (Robust interactive fixed effects (2021).
  The method iteratively updates beta (coefficients of the observable variables), group membership, and the latent factors (which can be common and group-specific) along
  with their loadings.
