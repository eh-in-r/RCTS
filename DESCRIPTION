Description: RCTS has the functionality to cluster time series using the robust interactive fixed effects framework. 
  This robust framework is developed in Boudt & Heyndels (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2022.01.002> and is a robust version of Ando & Bai (2017) <10.1080/01621459.2016.1195743>.
  The method iteratively updates beta (the coefficients of the observable variables), group membership, and the latent factors (which can be common and/or group-specific) along
  with their loadings. The number of groups and factors can be estimated if they are unknown.
